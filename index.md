## What is _Inkscape_? 

_Inkscape_ is a **free** and open source graphics editor that has a number of features to help you to **produce your own art and promotional materials like logos, posters, illustrations, typography, flow charts, and more.** 

## Choose your own Inkscape adventure!

**This workshop will begin with a look at _Inkscape_'s interface and then show you how to do the basics**, like draw some simple shapes, and use the **Selector** tool to move and scale objects. 

After your introduction to the _Inkscape_ interface you can choose what you want to do from a number of short tutorials, which you can complete in whatever order you like. Feel free to return to this online workshop after the session is over.

Have fun, and please ask for assistance any time.
